# Desktop Organizer - Ê°åÈù¢Êï¥ÁêÜÂä©Êâã

A .NET 8 WinForms application that uses AI to intelligently organize your Windows desktop files.

## üåü Features

- **AI-Powered Organization**: Uses LLM (Large Language Models) to analyze and categorize your desktop files
- **Multiple LLM Providers**: Supports DeepSeek, OpenAI, and Anthropic Claude
- **User Preferences**: Customizable folder rules and organization preferences
- **Preview & Adjust**: Visual preview of organization plan with drag-and-drop adjustments
- **Safe Operations**: One-click undo functionality and simulation mode
- **Secure API Key Storage**: Uses Windows Credential Manager for secure key storage
- **Multilingual Support**: English and Chinese interface

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The solution follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
DesktopOrganizer.sln
‚îú‚îÄ DesktopOrganizer.UI             # WinForms presentation layer
‚îú‚îÄ DesktopOrganizer.App            # Application services and orchestration
‚îú‚îÄ DesktopOrganizer.Domain         # Core business entities and interfaces
‚îî‚îÄ DesktopOrganizer.Infrastructure # Technical implementation (file system, HTTP, storage)
```

### Layer Responsibilities

- **Domain**: Core business logic, entities (Item, Plan, ModelProfile, Preferences), and interfaces
- **Infrastructure**: File system scanning, LLM API clients, credential management, repositories
- **Application**: Service orchestration, use case implementations, data transformation
- **UI**: WinForms controls, event handling, user interaction (no business logic)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10 21H2+ or Windows 11
- .NET 8 Desktop Runtime
- Internet connection for LLM API calls
- API key for at least one supported LLM provider

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd desktop-cleaner-claude
   ```

2. Build the solution:
   ```bash
   dotnet build DesktopOrganizer.sln
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project DesktopOrganizer.UI
   ```

### First-Time Setup

1. **Configure Model Profile**:
   - Click "Settings" in the toolbar
   - Add a new profile with your preferred LLM provider
   - Enter your API key securely

2. **Set Preferences**:
   - Configure folder rules in the preferences panel
   - Choose from quick templates or create custom rules
   - Adjust file size limits and ignored extensions

3. **Scan Desktop**:
   - Click "Scan" to analyze your desktop files
   - Review the file list in the original items panel

4. **Generate Organization Plan**:
   - Click "Analyze" to get AI recommendations
   - Watch the streaming log as the LLM processes your files
   - Review the suggested organization in the preview tree

5. **Execute or Adjust**:
   - Drag and drop items between folders to adjust the plan
   - Click "Execute" to organize your files
   - Use "Undo" if you need to revert changes

## üîß Configuration

### Model Profiles

The application supports multiple LLM providers:

- **DeepSeek**: `https://api.deepseek.com` with model `deepseek-chat`
- **OpenAI**: `https://api.openai.com` with models like `gpt-4`
- **Anthropic**: `https://api.anthropic.com` with models like `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`

### User Preferences

Stored in `%APPDATA%\DesktopOrganizer\preferences.json`:

```json
{
  "folderRules": {
    "Documents": [".pdf", ".doc", ".docx", ".txt"],
    "Pictures": [".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png", ".gif"],
    "Videos": [".mp4", ".avi", ".mkv", ".mov"]
  },
  "ignoreExtensions": [".tmp", ".log", ".cache"],
  "maxFileSizeBytes": 1073741824,
  "autoCreateFolders": true,
  "confirmBeforeExecution": true
}
```

### API Key Security

API keys are stored securely using Windows Credential Manager with the target format:
`DesktopOrganizer_{keyReference}`

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Project Structure

Each project follows the single responsibility principle:

- **Files ‚â§ 300 lines**: Maintains readability and testability
- **Methods ‚â§ 40 lines**: Ensures focused functionality
- **Async/await**: All I/O operations are asynchronous
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation and testability

### Key Design Patterns

- **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
- **Factory Pattern**: LLM client creation
- **Observer Pattern**: Progress reporting
- **Command Pattern**: Undo operations
- **MVP Pattern**: UI separation

### Adding New LLM Providers

1. Create a new client class implementing `ILLMClient`:
   ```csharp
   public class NewProviderClient : BaseLLMClient
   {
       // Implement ChatAsync and TestConnectionAsync
   }
   ```

2. Register in DI container:
   ```csharp
   services.AddHttpClient<NewProviderClient>();
   ```

3. Add to provider dropdown in ProfileEditDialog

### Testing

The architecture supports comprehensive testing:

- **Unit Tests**: Domain entities and application services
- **Integration Tests**: Infrastructure components
- **UI Tests**: Can be added for critical user workflows

## üìÅ File Locations

| File             | Location                                      | Purpose                         |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| User Preferences | `%APPDATA%\DesktopOrganizer\preferences.json` | Organization rules and settings |
| Model Profiles   | `%APPDATA%\DesktopOrganizer\models.json`      | LLM provider configurations     |
| Application Log  | `%USERPROFILE%\DesktopOrganizer.log`          | Runtime logs and errors         |
| Undo Data        | `%TEMP%\DesktopOrganizer_Undo.json`           | Last operation undo information |

## üîí Security & Privacy

- **Local Processing**: Files are never uploaded; only metadata is sent to LLM
- **API Key Encryption**: Stored in Windows Credential Manager
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only desktop and configuration directories access
- **HTTPS Only**: All API communications are encrypted
- **No Telemetry**: No usage data is collected or transmitted

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Found**:
   - Verify the key is set in Model Profile settings
   - Check Windows Credential Manager for the entry

2. **LLM Connection Failed**:
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check API key validity
   - Test connection in Model Profile dialog

3. **Files Not Moving**:
   - Check file permissions
   - Ensure files are not in use by other applications
   - Review execution logs for specific errors

4. **Undo Not Available**:
   - Undo data expires after application restart
   - Only the most recent operation can be undone

### Logging

Enable detailed logging by setting environment variable:
```bash
set DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT=Development
```

Check logs in: `%USERPROFILE%\DesktopOrganizer.log`
